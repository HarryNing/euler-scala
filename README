Herein lie solutions to Project Euler written in Scala. Begone from here if you
wish to some day savor the satisfaction of constructing solutions to these
problems yourself from naught but the whole cloth of your mind.

The value in these solutions, if any is to be had, is probably in reading the
code. You can conveniently do this directly via Github. However, if you possess
the urge to execute these solutions, a convenient script exists to do so. For
example:

% ./compilerun.sh 25

If you've read this far, you may also be interested in my discussion of said
solutions here:

Discussion seems to perpetually lag behind code by forty problems or so, but
maybe some day I'll catch up.
